This repository hosts all the Unity projects featured in our Mixed Reality (MR) [article series on dev.to](https://dev.to/tststs/series/26019). It provides a comprehensive collection of the practical examples and applications discussed throughout the series.

Once you have added a project to the Unity Hub and opened it, the next steps are to double-click the 'SampleScene' located in the 'Scenes' folder, and then switch to 'Android' in the build settings.
